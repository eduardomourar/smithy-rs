//! Extension types.
//!
//! Extension types are types that are stored in and extracted from _both_ requests and
//! responses.
//!
//! There is only one _generic_ extension type _for requests_, [`Extension`].
//!
//! On the other hand, the server SDK uses multiple concrete extension types for responses in order
//! to store a variety of information, like the operation that was executed, the operation error
//! that got returned, or the runtime error that happened, among others. The information stored in
//! these types may be useful to [`tower::Layer`]s that post-process the response: for instance, a
//! particular metrics layer implementation might want to emit metrics about the number of times an
//! an operation got executed.
//!
