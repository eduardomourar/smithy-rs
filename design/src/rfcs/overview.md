# RFCs

**What is an RFC?:** An RFC is a document that proposes a change to `smithy-rs` or the AWS Rust SDK. Request for Comments means a request for discussion and oversight about the future of the project from maintainers, contributors and users.

**When should I write an RFC?:** The AWS Rust SDK team proactively decides to write RFCs for major features or complex changes that we feel require extra scrutiny. However, the process can be used to request feedback on any change. Even changes that seem obvious and simple at first glance can be improved once a group of interested and experienced people have a chance to weigh in.

**Who can submit an RFC?:** An RFC can be submitted by anyone. In most cases, RFCs are authored by SDK maintainers, but everyone is welcome to submit RFCs.

**Where do I start?:** If you're ready to write and submit an RFC, please start a GitHub discussion with a summary of what you're trying to accomplish first. That way, the AWS Rust SDK team can ensure they have the bandwidth to review and shepherd the RFC through the whole process before you've expended effort in writing it. Once you've gotten the go-ahead, start with the [RFC template](./rfc_template.md).
